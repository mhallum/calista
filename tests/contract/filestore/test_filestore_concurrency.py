"""Concurrency deduplication contract test for the CAS filestore.

This test stresses the commit path by making multiple writers stage identical
bytes, then *simultaneously* attempt `commit()` using a Barrier+Event sync.
It asserts that all writers observe the same digest and that the object
round-trips correctly. Timeouts ensure failures donâ€™t hang the test.

    """Concurrent writers committing identical bytes deduplicate to one object.

    Setup:
      - Spawn N workers.
      - Each worker stages the same payload with `open_write().write(...)`.
      - All workers block on a barrier to align just before `commit()`.
      - Main thread releases them with an Event so they race the critical section.

    Expectations:
      - All commits return the *same* digest.
      - The digest exists in the store and round-trips to the original bytes.
      - Timeouts and barrier errors fail fast (no indefinite hangs).
